    "### As you know, in the United States the president is not elected by a direct vote, but by a two-level vote. First, elections are held in each state and the winner of the elections in that state is determined. Then the state elections are held: in these elections, each state has a certain number of votes - the number of electors from that state. In practice, all state electors vote according to the results of intra-state voting, that is, states with a different number of votes vote in the final stage of elections. You know who each state voted for and how many votes were cast by that state. Sum up the results of the elections: for each of the voting participants, determine the number of votes cast for him.\n",
